# webserve

Webserve is a very small webserver written in C as a proof-of-concept.

I've intentionally kept it very limited and basic, support of TLS planned by using mbedtls.

### Build instructions

Put your static files in fs/ and type:

```
$ make
```

### Installation

Not ready

### BUGS

Probably many. Use at your own risk, better in an isolated environment.

Enojoy. :D
